Computer Science and Data Analytics Projects

# [Project 1: My Final Year Project](https://github.com/JoshuaLim12/FYP-Predictive-Modelling-Future-In-Demand-Skills)
This is my Final Year Project, completed during my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Analytics at Asia Pacific University. The project focuses on using predictive machine learning models to forecast future skill demands by analyzing job posting datasets. By addressing a multiclass classification problem, this work aims to tackle real-world challenges such as underemployment and skill mismatch in the tech industry. The project explores various machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to develop an accurate and practical solution for understanding trends in skill requirements.

# [Project 2: SQL Database Security](https://github.com/JoshuaLim12/SQL-Database-Security-)
This project provides a database security enhancement, built in MS-SQL to address data security requirements. Implements RBAC, enforcing strict permissions and access levels. Includes data classification, encryption, automated backups, and an auditing mechanism to track all user activities, login attempts, and data modifications.

# [Project 3: Image Classification Using CNN Deap Learning Algorithm](https://github.com/JoshuaLim12/CNN-Deep-Learning-Image-Classification)
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for a 6-class image classification task, using a dataset of natural scenes comprising categories like buildings, forests, glaciers, mountains, seas, and streets. With a focus on efficient preprocessing and model optimization, the project leverages deep learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions while analyzing the model's performance.

# [Project 4: Real Time Warehouse Management System Using Rust](https://github.com/JoshuaLim12/Real-Time-Warehouse-Management-System-Rust)
This project involved developing a warehouse management system using the Rust programming language, incorporating real-time concepts such as threads, RabbitMQ, and channels to ensure efficient task execution. The system demonstrated concurrency, communication between subsystems, and both scheduled and event-based task handling. Designed to prioritize speed, reliability, and resource efficiency, the project also included a benchmarking analysis to compare performance against a classmate's simulation.
